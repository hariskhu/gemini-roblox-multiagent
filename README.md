# AI Multiagent in Roblox with Gemini

An AI multiagent that uses Google Gemini to interact with players through the chat and interact with the game environment. In-game logs are sent to an external MongoDB database to evaluate outputs and improve prompts.

## Features

- Chat interaction: the main agent (Gemini 2.0 Flash with thinking and Google Search grounding enabled) uses the chat to communicate with players and respond to their requests.
- Hierachical memory: logs of chat messages and actions are summarized by a short-term memory agent (Gemini 2.0 with thinking enabled). When the short-term summary becomes too long, a long-term summary agent (Gemini 2.5) reduces it further. This helps save on API costs.
- Context caching: prompts are cached using the Gemini API to keep costs even lower as users increase.
- Tool use: the main agent uses preset functions to do things like give players items, change their attributes, and spawn structures. Sub-agents are able to access the list of models and tools available. 
- Action Log Database: built with Flask and MongoDB Atlas, a REST API holds logs of actions, chat messages, and output generated by the summary agents.
